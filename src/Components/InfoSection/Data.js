While living in the Sedona, AZ area for 22 years, I discovered my healing abilities as an Animal Communicator/Intuitive,  Animal Reiki Practitioner and Equestrian Life Coach. Today, I can be found in the quaint, equestrian city of Aiken, SC.",

    "A way of understanding one another through visions, images, feelings, emotions, smells, thoughts and a deep knowing that is not based on verbal language. It is the natural way all animals communicate with one another and with us. It is their primary language. Each animal has their own unique personality. Some are comedians, some are very stoic and some are chatter boxes. They have their own agenda and purpose, and may even have advice for their person.",
